# mechbot

MechBot is a Discord bot that helps you find things you're looking for on reddit.com/r/mechmarket/ by filtering new posts based on alerts that you set up. You'll recieve a DM on Discord from MechBot as soon as anything you're interested in is posted. 

If you're a mech hobbyist that stumbled upon this I hope you find it useful! This is a side project I'm working on to learn Django/PostgreSQL that would also help me and my friends get stuff we want on mechmarket. It's up and functional but I'm still updating the UI for the site and some discord functionality (not related to notifying you about mechmarket posts). 

https://mechbot.panamahat.dev/ to set up alerts or you can host the whole thing yourself if you don't mind the trouble, it's all here.
